      "name": "   Commercial Zones",
      "description": "17.10.010 Purpose and intent. 17.10.020 Commercial districts. 17.10.030 Design standards and guidelines. 17.10.040 Allowed uses. 17.10.050 Floor area ratios (FAR). 17.10.060 Maximum building height. 17.10.070 Setbacks and required sidewalk width. 17.10.080 Parking and loading. 17.10.090 Landscaping and screening. 17.10.100 Fences. 17.10.110 Signs. 17.10.120 Relationship to AICUZ. The intent of these commercial district regulations is to implement the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, the downtown plan, and the US 2 corridor plan. These areas are intended to bring employment, shopping, civic, recreational, and residential activities along the US 2 corridor and in emerging commercial nodes. New development and redevelopment is encouraged in these districts to promote a relatively cohesive development pattern with a mix of uses, higher density housing, buildings oriented to the street, screened parking areas behind buildings, alternative modes of transportation with a safe pedestrian environment, quality design, smaller blocks and relatively narrow streets with on-street parking. (Ord. C-962 \u00a7 12, 2021) A. C-1 Downtown. The intent of the C-1 downtown zone is to facilitate development of an identity-rich, mixed-use, and compact downtown environment. Whether located along US 2 or at the core of another smaller commercial district, the C-1 zone is intended to create and sustain an environment of commercial vitality, pedestrian movement, civic activity, a mix of housing types, and social interaction. This district implements the Comprehensive Plan\u2019s commercial land use designation. This zone promotes the greatest pedestrian orientation of the City\u2019s commercial zones. To accomplish this, some limitations are placed on auto-oriented activities and some types and the allowable size of some uses are controlled. B. C-1A Downtown Transition. The intent of the C-1A downtown transition zone is to facilitate development in those places along the US 2 corridor near the C-1 zone that manage the transition between a corridor focused on highway access and the slower-paced downtown district. Development and land use in this zone shall more closely approach the roadway edge, place less emphasis on parking lots, add architectural detail and be more accommodating of pedestrian movement than development in the C-2 zone, contributing to a visual environment that slows speed on US 2 as travelers approach the C-1 zone. Development in this zone may have a greater emphasis on ground-floor residential uses, offer more surface parking and rely more on direct highway access than development in the C-1 zone. It promotes new development and redevelopment that is pedestrian-oriented while also accommodating the automobile. C. C-2 Highway Corridor. The intent of the C-2 highway corridor zone is to permit large-scale development reliant on highway access and visibility, where uses benefit from high vehicular trip counts and cater to drivers of private vehicles by providing visible, convenient parking and a range of retail, institutional, office, civic, recreational, and residential uses to meet the community\u2019s needs. While the priority of this zone is to emphasize vehicular access, public transportation, pedestrians, and cyclists are also served, with dedicated, safe facilities. (Ord. C-962 \u00a7 13, 2021) All development in the C-1, C-1A, and C-2 districts shall address the pertinent design standards and guidelines. A. Administration and Interpretation. This section assigns standards related to site plan and building design and shall be interpreted by staff as part of land use permit or building permit review, as appropriate. Building plans shall be submitted in sufficient detail to permit accurate staff review of these provisions, including, but not limited to, site plans and exterior elevations as required by AHMC 14.03.030. An applicant may seek relief by the Technical Review Committee, provided alternative design enhancements are proposed in place of those requirements not able to be met. B. Ground Floor Windows. These provisions apply to nonresidential building facades between two feet and 10 feet above the level of the adjacent sidewalk, walkway or ground level. 1. A minimum of 50 percent of any ground floor nonresidential building facade that is visible from and located within 20 feet of the lot line of an arterial street designated on the arterial street plan shall be comprised of windows with clear, \u201cvision\u201d glass allowing views into the interior. Display windows may be used to meet half of this requirement. 2. A minimum of 30 percent of any ground floor nonresidential building facade that is visible from, fronting on, and located within 60 feet of the lot line of an arterial street designated on the arterial street plan shall be comprised of windows with clear, \u201cvision\u201d glass allowing views into the interior. Display windows may be used to meet half of this requirement. 3. For portions of facades that do not have windows, see guidelines for treating blank walls, subsection (H) of this section. C. Facade Detail. 1. Buildings shall have a distinct \u201cbase\u201d at the ground level, using articulation and materials such as stone, masonry, or decorative concrete. 2. The \u201ctop\u201d of the building shall be treated with a distinct outline with elements such as a projecting parapet, cornice, or projection. D. Articulation. 1. Facades longer than 50 feet shall be broken down into smaller units through the use of offsets, recesses, staggered walls, stepped walls, pitched or stepped rooflines, overhangs and other elements of the building\u2019s mass. Simply changing materials or color is not sufficient to accomplish this. 2. Articulation shall be provided along facades visible from the street, as well as from neighboring residential areas. E. Prominent Entrance. Principal building entries shall be marked by at least one element from Group A and one element from Group B: 1. Group A. a. Large entry doors. b. Recessed entrance. c. Protruding entrance. 2. Group B. a. Canopy. b. Portico. c. Overhang. F. Ground Level Details. 1. Ground level of building shall be pedestrian-friendly in scale, expression and use of materials. 2.

Buildings may be set back from the front property line the minimum distance necessary to allow space for the construction of a 10-foot-wide public sidewalk. 2. Buildings may be set back to allow for outdoor seating, small item or public art display areas, additional pedestrian circulation, or other public purpose not devoted to automobile circulation. K. Parking Lots. In the C-1 zone, surface parking shall observe the following location standards and otherwise comply with provisions of Chapter 17.21 AHMC: 1. Parking lots shall not be located between buildings and US 2, 14th Ave or 6th Ave. 2. Access to parking lots (driveways) shall not be from US 2, 14th Ave or 6th Ave if another option, such as an alley, is available. L. Mixed Uses. Mixed-use development shall observe the following design standards and otherwise comply with the development standards specified in underlying zoning districts: 1. Ground-floor ceiling height for mixed-use buildings shall be no less than 14 feet from finished floor. 2. Mixed-use developments shall be a minimum of two stories in height. 3. No residential use shall be permitted to be located along the street edge. 4. Sound mitigation shall be required if a proposed project is located within a 65-CNEL or higher sound contour, such that the decibel level produced by exterior noise sources is reduced by a minimum of 25 dB noise-level-reduction when heard from the interior of the structure. 5. Parking requirements for mixed-use developments may be reduced in accordance with Chapter 17.21 AHMC and allowances for shared or complementary parking. 6. Metal siding, metal pole buildings, and manufactured housing shall not be permitted in mixed-use projects. 7. Mixed-use projects shall provide enclosures for recyclable and garbage collection points, as outlined in Chapter 17.25 AHMC. (Ord. C-962 \u00a7 14, 2021) The uses allowed in the C-1, C-1A, and C-2 zones are shown in Table 17.10.040. This table is to be used in conjunction with Table 1 in Chapter 17.05 AHMC and the definitions in Chapter 17.04 AHMC to assure accurate classification of uses. Additional information about permitted uses in aircraft accident potential areas or in areas where noise contours exceed 65 CNEL is provided in Chapter 17.16 AHMC, JLUS Protections for Fairchild Air Force Base. A. Administration and Interpretation. The Director or designee shall review proposed development applications and determine their appropriateness for location in the applicable zoning districts in accordance with AHMC 14.02.020 and 17.05.030. This is a guide that requires application of Chapter 17.04 AHMC, Definitions, Chapter 17.05 AHMC, Zone Classifications, Map, and Matrix, and Chapter 17.16 AHMC, JLUS Protections for Fairchild Air Force Base. B. Types of Permits. 1. Permitted (P). Uses identified as permitted may be allowed subject to the standards of the zoning ordinance and other applicable provisions of the AHMC. 2. Not Permitted (N). Uses identified as not permitted may not be allowed to locate in the zoning district where the use is not permitted. 3. Permitted with Limitations (L). Uses identified as permitted with limitations may locate in the appropriate zoning districts provided they comply with special regulations or design standards to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses and consistency with Airway Heights\u2019 policy. The Director or designee will evaluate each application for compliance with applicable special regulations or design standards. 4. Conditionally Permitted (C). Uses identified as conditionally permitted may be permitted subject to issuance of a conditional use permit in accordance with Chapter 14.03 AHMC. P \u2013 Permitted | N \u2013 Not permitted | L \u2013 Permitted with limitations | C \u2013 Conditionally permitted To determine the allowed gross floor area of all buildings or structures allowed on a site, the FAR in Table 17.10.050 is multiplied by the area of the lot. Exceptions. A. Hotels and motels (including bed and breakfast inns) are considered residential uses for the purpose of FAR. B. Exclusions from Floor Area Calculations. 1. Floor area dedicated to parking. 2. Elevators, staircases, escalators and mechanical spaces. 3. Exterior decks, porches and arcades open to the air. 4. Floor area dedicated to public amenities. (Ord. C-962 \u00a7 16, 2021) Table 17.10.060 sets forth the maximum building and structure heights for each zone. Each structure, development or activity shall comply with these requirements except as otherwise provided in this chapter. Regardless of minimum setback, buildings shall be no closer than 12 feet from the face of the curb and shall always be constructed on private property. A. Sidewalks shall be at least 12 feet wide and consist of a clear walking path at least eight feet wide (in addition to a planting zone for street trees). B. This width may be reduced, by approval of the Technical Review Committee, if the existing sidewalk is less than 12 feet wide between the face of curb and the existing building setback line of adjacent building(s). In no case shall the setback be reduced below nine feet from the face of the curb, unless on-street parking exists between the building and the street. In that instance, the sidewalk shall maintain a clear walking path of at least seven feet wide. C. Minimum setback standards measured from the property line are found in Table 17.10.070. The standards pertaining to the minimum required and maximum allowed number of auto parking spaces, minimum required number of bicycle parking spaces, parking lot placement, parking lot setbacks, and internal parking lot pedestrian connections are stated in Chapter 17.21 AHMC, Parking and Loading. (Ord. C-962 \u00a7 19, 2021) The standards for landscaping and screening are stated in Chapter 17.22 AHMC, Landscaping. (Ord. C-962 \u00a7 20, 2021) A. Purpose. The fence standards promote the positive benefits of fences without adversely impacting the community or endangering public or vehicle safety. Fences near streets are kept low to allow visibility into and out of the site and to ensure visibility for motorists. Fences in any required side or rear setback are limited in height not to conflict with the purpose for the setback. B. Type of Fences. The standards apply to walls, fences, and screens of all types whether open, solid, wood, metal, wire, masonry, or other material. C. Location, Height, and Design. 1. Street Setbacks. No fence or other structure is allowed within 12 feet from the face of the curb, consistent with the required sidewalk width of AHMC 17.10.070. 2. Measured from Front Lot Line. Fences up to three and one-half feet high are allowed in a required street setback that is measured from a front lot line. 3. Measured from a Side Lot Line. Fences up to six feet high are allowed in a required setback that is measured from a side lot line. 4. Fences shall not reduce the required setback width of AHMC 17.10.070. D. Side or Rear Structure Setbacks. Fences up to six feet high are allowed in required side or rear setbacks except when the side or rear setback abuts a pedestrian connection. When the side or rear setback abuts a pedestrian connection, fences are limited to three and one-half feet in height. E. Not in Setbacks. The height for fences that are not in required setbacks is the same as the regular height limits of the zone. F. Sight-Obscuring Fences and Walls. Any sight-obscuring fences, walls, and other structures over three and one-half feet high and within 15 feet of a street lot line shall either be placed on the interior side of an L2 see-through buffer landscaping area at least five feet in depth (See Chapter 17.22 AHMC, Landscaping), or meet the treatment of blank walls intent outlined in AHMC 17.10.030(H). G. Prohibited Fences. 1. No person may erect or maintain a fence or barrier consisting of or containing barbed, razor, concertina, or similar wire. 2. No person may maintain a fence or barrier charged with electricity. 3.

No fence may be closer than 12 feet to the curb. H. Visibility at Intersections. 1. A fence, wall, hedge or other improvement shall conform to Chapter 17.22 AHMC and shall not be erected or maintained at the corner of a lot so as to obstruct the view of travelers upon the streets. 2. Subject to the authority of the traffic engineer to make adjustments and special requirements in particular cases, all fences, vegetation, and other features within the clear view triangle defined in Chapter 17.19 AHMC shall be maintained to keep a vertical clear view zone between three and eight feet from ground level. I. Enclosures for Pools, Hot Tubs, or Ponds. 1. A person maintaining a swimming pool, hot tub, pond or other impoundment of water exceeding 5,000 gallons and 18 inches or more in depth and located on private property is required to construct and maintain an approved fence by which the pool or water feature is enclosed and inaccessible by small children. 2. The required pool enclosure must be at least 54 inches high and may be a fence, wall, building, or other structure approved by the Building Services Department. 3. If the enclosure is a woven wire fence, it is required to be built to discourage climbing. 4. No opening, except a door or gate may exceed four inches in any dimension. 5. Any door or gate in the pool enclosure, except when part of the occupied dwelling unit, must have self-closing and self-locking equipment by which the door or gate is kept secure when not in use. A latch or lock release on the outside of the door or gate must be 54 inches above the ground. 6. Outside of the door or gate must be at least 54 inches above the ground. J. Reference to Other Standards. Building permits are required by the Building Services Department for all fences including the replacement of existing fences. A permit is not required to repair an existing fence. (Ord. C-962 \u00a7 21, 2021) Sign standards are stated in Chapter 17.23 AHMC for all land within commercial zones, except that no pole signs shall be permitted in the C-1 zone. (Ord.

The purpose and intent of the light industrial zone (I-1) is to implement the industrial category of the Comprehensive Plan. The light industrial zone provides a location for high technology industrial and incidental commercial uses of a light intensity, which has minimal environmental impacts. Restrictive development standards of this zone are intended to result in a clean, quiet industrial development, with primary activities conducted in enclosed buildings. Developments in this zone are characterized by parklike grounds and attractive buildings, which are compatible with nearby residential and commercial land uses. In the light industrial zone, no building or premises shall be used nor any building or structure hereafter erected or altered unless otherwise provided in this chapter. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 159, 2008) Land uses permitted in the I-1 zone are listed in the zoning matrix. Any land or buildings in the light industrial zone may hereafter be used, or may be constructed to be used, for industrial uses and those commercial uses allowed in the C-2 zone, except for those commercial uses only permitted in the C-1 zone. The City Planner and Code Enforcement Officer are to determine if compatibility exists between uses. Industrial uses are the uses of land and buildings for manufacturing, processing, fabrication, assembly, freight handling, or similar operations. In the light industrial zone, all industrial operations shall: A. Be carried on in such a manner and with such precautions against fire and explosion hazards as to be acceptable to the City Fire Chief or designee; B.

      "name": "   Airport Overlay Zone",
      "description": "17.15.010 Purpose and intent. 17.15.020 Applicability. 17.15.030 Exemptions. 17.15.040 Airport overlay zone boundaries. 17.15.050 General use restrictions. 17.15.060 Height restrictions. 17.15.070 Compatibility use categories. 17.15.080 Airport overlay compatible uses. 17.15.090 Limited use standards. 17.15.100 Development standards. A. The purpose of the airport overlay zone is to protect the viability of the Spokane International Airport as a significant resource to the community by requiring compatible land uses and densities, reducing hazards to lives and properties, and ensuring a safe and secure flying environment, consistent with federal aviation regulations. B. The overlay zone is in addition to existing zoning districts. Where the overlay zone and/or portions thereof are shown outside of the current City limits it is meant to be advisory to adjacent jurisdictions until such time as said areas may be annexed into and become part of the City. C. The airport overlay zone modifies the density and land use standards of the underlying zoning districts. These modifications provide protection to the public, health, safety, and general welfare of the community, airport users, and citizens working and residing within the airport overlay zone. (Ord. C-960 \u00a7 3, 2021) The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands, buildings, structures, natural features, or uses located within those areas that are defined by the airport overlay zone designated on the official zoning map unless otherwise exempted pursuant to AHMC 17.15.030, Exemptions. Provided, the provisions of this chapter shall have not regulatory effect in areas located outside of the City until such time as said areas may be annexed into and become part of the City. (Ord. C-960 \u00a7 4, 2021) Necessary aviation facilities, air navigation facilities, airport visual approach or aircraft arresting devices, meteorological devices, aviation industry related maintenance, aviation training and education facilities approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the Department of Defense, for which the location and height are fixed by their functional purpose, are exempt from the provisions of the airport overlay zone when permitted in the underlying zoning district; provided, that the use will not penetrate the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77 surfaces, attract wildlife that is hazardous to aviation, impact airport operations, or create a safety impact as determined by the airport director. (Ord. C-960 \u00a7 5, 2021) In order to carry out the purpose and intent of the airport overlay zone as set forth above, and to restrict those uses which may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and from airports within the City of Spokane and Spokane County, the following airspace and land use safety areas are established: A. Spokane International Airport Overlay Zone. 1. Surface Overlay Zones. a. Five airport land use airport compatibility zones (ACZ) are based upon Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Division of Aviation guidelines. These are further based on federal aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and FAA and are shown on the airport overlay zone map maintained by the Planning Department. b. Airport Noise Zone. Those areas within 1,000 feet of where it has been determined that existing or potential noise levels exceed 65 LdN (day-night average sound level). The Planning Department maintains the official map that shows where substantial noise impact areas occur or are anticipated and shall be amended when conditions change or as new information becomes available. 2. Airspace Overlay Zones. Federal Aviation Regulations Part 77 establishes civil airport imaginary surfaces for the regulation of airspace surrounding airports. These imaginary surfaces and any revisions made thereto are adopted by reference and made an official part of this chapter. The size of each imaginary surface is based on the category of each runway according to the type of approach available or planned for that runway. The slope and dimensions of the approach surface applied to each end of a runway are determined by the most precise approach existing or planned for that runway end. The Planning Services Department shall make available to the public upon request up-to-date maps and descriptions of the FAR 77 Civil Airport Imaginary Surfaces. (Ord. C-960 \u00a7 6, 2021) A. No use shall be made of any land in the airport overlay zone that would cause any one of the following circumstances: 1. The use creates or causes interference with the operations of radio or electronic facilities at the airport or with radio or electronic communications between the airport and aircraft. 2. The use makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights. 3. The use results in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airports. 4. The use impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport. 5. The use creates thermal plumes hazardous to aircraft. 6. The use endangers the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 7. The use creates a wildlife attractant that, in the opinion of the airport director, could interfere with aircraft operations. 8. The use would create a fire accelerant or secondary explosion resulting from an aircraft crash in a surface overlay zone. B. The following restrictions also apply: 1. Prior to the issuance of a building or land use permit in any of the surface overlay zones defined herein, the awarding of an avigation easement by the property owner(s) to the appropriate airport(s) shall be required and recorded with the Spokane County Auditor\u2019s office. 2. Prior to the issuance of a permit that requires SEPA review or any Type II land use permit within the surface overlay zones, a copy of the proposal shall be routed to the appropriate official(s) at Spokane International Airport for review and comment. 3. In all cases, the filing of an FAA Form 7460-1 (or any other appropriate federal forms necessary to comply with federal airport laws) with the FAA Northwest Mountain Region may also be required, based on the overall height, location, and/or nature of the proposed construction as directed by CFR Part 77.13. (Ord. C-960 \u00a7 7, 2021) Structures or vegetation shall not be constructed, altered, maintained, or allowed to grow into any airspace overlay zone as defined in AHMC 17.15.040(A)(2) and (B)(2). Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. No structure shall be erected so high as to increase the Federal Aviation Administration landing and/or approach and/or departure minimums for aircraft using the runways of the affected airports, unless the airport operator approves of such action. The following items are exempt from this provision: A. Any structure or object that would be shielded by existing permanent structures or by natural terrain or topographic features of equal or greater height. B. Any air navigation facility, airport visual approach or landing aid, aircraft arresting device, or meteorological device of a type approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, or an appropriate military service at military airports, with a fixed location and height. C. Structures necessary and incidental to airport operations. D. Administrative Height Exceptions. The Planning Director may, as part of a development permit application process, administratively grant height exceptions after a review of the proposal and issuance of written findings that the proposed development meets the following criteria: 1. The applicant has complied with the Federal Aviation Administration Form 7460-1 review process (Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration) and provided documentation from FAA that this review process is complete and that FAA has no objections to the proposed development. 2. The other requirements of this chapter have been satisfied. Further, the development shall meet at least one of the following criteria: a. The improvement would be shielded by an adjacent or nearby existing permanent structure or natural terrain feature of equal or greater height compared to the proposed structure. b. The improvement is an air navigation facility, airport visual approach or landing aid, aircraft arresting device, or meteorological device, of a type approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. c. The proposal is a military service and support improvement, with a fixed location and height which are necessary and incidental to base operations as certified in writing by the Fairchild Air Force Base. The Director may require an applicant to provide such technical documentation and illustrations necessary to demonstrate that the proposed development will not threaten or reduce aircraft safety. 3. The following items are exempt from this provision: a. Any structure or object that would be shielded by existing permanent structures or by natural terrain or topographic features of equal or greater height. b. Any air navigation facility, airport visual approach or landing aid, aircraft arresting device, or meteorological device, of a type approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. c. Structures necessary and incidental to airport operations. d. Incinerator(s) and/or associated structure(s) owned and/or operated by a municipal corporation and/or political subdivision, either individually or jointly. (Ord. C-960 \u00a7 8, 2021) A. This section classifies land uses and activities into use categories on the basis of common characteristics that are potentially compatible or incompatible with both civil and military airports. Uses that put people in harm\u2019s way, increase the risk or severity of an aircraft accident, endanger public infrastructure, or reduce the long-term functionality and economic viability of the region\u2019s civil and military aviation facilities are considered incompatible. B. Uses Not Listed. Examples of uses that are included in the use category are provided. The names of uses on the lists are generic. They are based on the common meaning of the terms and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use whose business name is \u201cwholesale liquidation\u201d but that sells mostly to consumers would be considered a retail sales use rather than a wholesale sales use. As such it would be in the high-intensity uses category rather than the low-intensity uses category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the retail sales and service category. A use may not be listed but may have the same incompatible characteristics as a listed use. The Planning Services Director may determine that a proposed use has similar incompatible characteristics as other uses that are permitted or not permitted in the respective airport overlay zone, and therefore should also be permitted or not permitted. C. Accessory Uses. Accessory uses are permitted only when they would be permitted as a standalone use. For example, in a zone that prohibits a daycare but allows an office use, a daycare would not be allowed as an accessory use. Except that an office that is accessory to a use in the low-intensity uses category may be permitted pursuant to subsection (D)(6) of this section. D. Use Categories. 1. Residential Uses. Residential uses are considered incompatible because in addition to safety concerns they are sensitive to noise impacts. Examples of residential uses include group living, single-family residences, duplexes, apartments, condominiums, manufactured home and mobile home parks. This does not include hotels and motels in which occupancy is arranged for time periods less than one month. 2. High-Intensity Uses. High-intensity uses are uses that have the potential to concentrate a large number of people in a small area. These uses are considered incompatible because of their potential to put a large number of people in harm\u2019s way. Examples of high-intensity uses include religious institutions, theaters, auditoriums, arenas, concert halls, amphitheaters, lodges, meeting halls, fraternal organizations, gymnasiums and exercise facilities, skating rinks, bowling alleys, arcades, batting cages, community centers, universities, museums, public libraries, funeral homes, arenas, outdoor amphitheaters, outdoor spectator sports, racetracks, speedways, amusement parks, splash pads, campgrounds, fairgrounds, zoos, circuses, carnivals, eating and drinking establishments, farmers markets, retail sales and services, malls and shopping centers, hotels, motels, auctions, offices, labor intensive manufacturing, bus and rail passenger terminals, and mass shelters. 3. Vulnerable Occupant Uses. Vulnerable occupant uses are uses in which a majority of occupants are children, elderly, or disabled or other people who have reduced ability or are unable to respond to emergencies or get out of harm\u2019s way. Examples of vulnerable occupant uses include daycare centers, family daycares, schools (grades K-12), hospitals, other health care facilities where anesthesia is used or patients remain overnight, correctional facilities, retirement homes, nursing homes, and convalescent facilities. 4. Critical Community Infrastructure. Critical community infrastructure includes facilities that the damage or destruction of which would cause significant adverse effects to public health and welfare beyond the immediate vicinity of the facility. Examples of critical community infrastructure include police stations, fire stations, emergency communication facilities, power plants, and waste water treatment facilities. 5. Hazardous Uses. Hazardous uses are uses that release discharge into the air such as smoke, steam, or particulates that impair air visibility, uses that have aboveground storage or uses that require the storage of large quantities of hazardous (flammable, explosive, corrosive, or toxic) materials that have the potential to exacerbate an aircraft accident, or uses that attract wildlife hazardous to aircraft. Examples of hazardous uses include aboveground chemical or fuel storage exceeding household quantities, mining, rendering plants, slaughter houses, stock yards, and feed lots. 6. Low-Intensity Uses. Low-intensity uses do not concentrate people or hazardous material into small areas, are not sensitive to loud noise and do not directly or indirectly inhibit aviation operations. Examples of low-intensity uses include agricultural uses (that do not attract wildlife hazardous to aviation operations), kennels, animal clinics, motorcycle, automotive, truck, marine craft, manufactured home and travel trailer sales (except for auctions), commercial parking, quick vehicle service, maintenance and repair shops, towing services, taxicab terminals, wholesale sales, ministorage, warehouses, nonlabor intensive manufacturing, printing and publishing, cemeteries, trails, rail lines, roads, underground utilities. Low-intensity uses may include a small accessory office in which on-site uses are managed. Larger offices in which business involves matters not related to uses on site are considered high-intensity uses even when combined with a use that is in the low-intensity uses category. (Ord. C-960 \u00a7 9, 2021) A. Permitted Uses (P). Uses permitted in the airport overlay zone are listed in Table 17.15.080-1 with a \u201cP.\u201d These uses are allowed if they comply with these standards and other standards of this chapter and are permitted in the underlying zone. When airport overlay zones overlap the proposed use must be permitted in every overlay zone that applies to the subject property or the use is not permitted. B. Limited Uses (L). Uses permitted that are subject to limitations are listed in Table 17.15.080-1 with an \u201cL.\u201d These uses are allowed if they comply with the limitations as listed in the footnotes following the table and the development standards and other standards of this chapter and are permitted in the underlying zones. The subsections in AHMC 17.15.090 contain the limitations and correspond with the bracketed [ ] footnote numbers from Table 17.15.080-1. C. Conditional Uses (CU). Uses that are allowed if approved through the conditional use review process are listed in Table 17.15.080-1 with a \u201cCU.\u201d These uses are allowed provided they comply with the conditional use approval criteria for that use, the development standards and other standards of this chapter and are permitted in the underlying zones. Uses listed with a \u201cCU\u201d that also have a footnote number in the table are subject to the standards cited in the footnote. The conditional use review process and approval criteria are stated in AHMC 17.03.100, Conditional uses. D. Uses Not Permitted (N). Uses listed in Table 17.15.080-1 with an \u201cN\u201d are not permitted. Existing uses in categories listed as not permitted are subject to the standards of AHMC 17.03.170, Nonconforming uses.   Where a maximum density is specified it is the intent of these provisions to prohibit large numbers of people concentrated into a small area and that no portion of a site shall be permitted to be developed into facilities that contain occupancy capacity for more than the number of people specified per acre. Except that in some instances, after consulting with airport personnel, the Planning Services Director may make a determination that a clustering of density will make the proposed use more compatible with airport operations because of the location of flight patterns. A. Residential Living. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 17.15.080-1 that have a note [1]. 1. In the airport noise zones and ACZ-2 and ACZ-3 one single-family home is permitted on each existing lot where the underlying zoning is R-1, R-2 and R-3. Residential uses are not permitted where the underlying zoning is commercial or industrial. More than one residential unit may be permitted in the R-2 and R-3 zones. The density shall not exceed the existing average density on the adjoining properties. The average density of the adjoining properties shall be calculated by dividing the combined number of residential units on all the adjoining properties by the combined acreage of the adjoining properties excluding property dedicated as right-of-way. Subdivisions that result in additional residential lots or zoning changes that allow for further densification are not permitted after the adoption date of this chapter. 2. Residential uses are permitted in ACZ-5 only when the underlying zoning is R-1, R-2 and R-3 except that mobile and manufactured home parks are not permitted. Residential uses are not permitted where the underlying zoning is commercial or industrial. B. High-Intensity Uses. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 17.15.080-1 that have a note [2]. 1. In ACZ-2 religious institutions, funeral homes, libraries, non-aviation-related museums, fraternal organizations, and entertainment oriented uses (amusement park, bowling alley, theater, stadiums, and arenas, etc.) are not permitted. Sales and services oriented uses, eating and drinking establishments, offices, hotels, and motels are allowed when permitted by the underlying zoning at a net density not exceeding 40 persons per acre calculated by dividing the building code occupancy of all structures on the site by the acreage of the subject site not including property that has been dedicated as right-of-way. 2. In ACZ-3 religious institutions, funeral homes, libraries, non-aviation-related museums, fraternal organizations, and entertainment oriented uses (amusement park, bowling alley, theater, stadiums, and arenas, etc.) are not permitted. Sales and services oriented uses, eating and drinking establishments, offices, hotels, and motels are allowed when permitted by the underlying zoning at a net density not exceeding 70 persons per acre calculated by dividing the building code occupancy of all structures on the site by the acreage of the subject site not including property that has been dedicated as right-of-way. 3. In ACZ-4 airport uses and associated activities such as offices, restaurants and eateries serving airport users are the only high-intensity uses permitted when allowed in the underlying zone. 4. In ACZ-5 non-aviation-related museums, horse racing tracks, speedways, stadiums, and arenas are not permitted. All other high-intensity uses are allowed when permitted by the underlying zoning at a net density not exceeding 180 persons per acre calculated by dividing the building code occupancy of all structures on the site by the acreage of the subject site not including property that has been dedicated as right-of-way. C. High-Intensity Uses. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 17.15.080-1 that have a note [3]. High-intensity uses are allowed when permitted by the underlying zoning except for religious institutions, libraries, and outdoor amphitheaters. D. Vulnerable Occupants Use. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 17.15.080-1 that have a note [4]. Uses with vulnerable occupants may be allowed when permitted in the underlying zone at a net density not exceeding 180 persons per acre calculated by dividing the building code occupancy of all structures on the site by the acreage of the subject site not including property that has been dedicated as right-of-way. Except that retirement homes, nursing homes, convalescent facilities, assisted living residences, community care facilities, daycares, preschools, hospitals and schools (grades K-12) are not permitted. E. Critical Community Infrastructure. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 17.15.080-1 that have a note [5]. Police, fire stations, and ambulance service uses are allowed when permitted in the underlying zone. No other critical community infrastructure is permitted. F. Sound Insulation Requirements. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 17.15.080-1 that have a note [6]. Structures intended for human occupancy shall be designed to achieve an interior noise level not exceeding 45 decibels. G. Hazardous Uses. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 17.15.080-1 that have a note [7]. 1. Mining may be permitted in ACZ-2 and ACZ-3 with Type II conditional use permit if the Hearing Examiner, after consulting airport, finds that the proposed mining operation will not create a hazard for aviation operations. 2. Hazardous uses may be permitted in ACZ-5 with Type II conditional use permit if the Hearing Examiner, after consulting airport, finds that the proposed use will not create a hazard for aviation operations or significantly exacerbate an aircraft accident. H. ACZ-1. This regulation applies to all parts of Table 17.15.080-1 that have a note [8]. No aboveground structures or utilities are permitted. Except that on lots existing prior to the adoption of this chapter the minimal structures necessary to allow for reasonable and economically viable use of the property may be permitted when the director determines that the structure(s) would not threaten public health, safety, or welfare on or off the property. The inability of the applicants to derive an economically viable use shall not be the result of actions by the applicant in subdividing the property, adjusting boundary lines or other land use activity thereby creating the undevelopable conditions after the effective date of this chapter. (Ord. C-960 \u00a7 11, 2021) The following standards shall apply to all development within the airport compatibility zones 1 through 5: A. Stormwater facilities shall be designed in compliance with the Washington State Department of Transportation Aviation Stormwater Design Manual \u2013 Best Management Practices. B.

There may be situations in which the basic provisions of this title may be modified to permit the improvement of land by what is known as a planned unit development (PUD). The Planning Commission may, after giving notice as required by law and holding a public hearing, recommend approval of a PUD and apply conditions of approval for performance and improvements. Planned unit developments (PUDs) shall be permitted in residential zones unless otherwise stated in this title. All PUDs shall conform to the subdivision requirements of AHMC Title 16. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 220, 2008) It is intended that a PUD be used as an overlay zone in conjunction with the underlying zone to permit a greater degree of flexibility and diversification in the design of a development. Preservation of unique site features and open space is one function of a PUD. Other characteristics include, but are not limited to, private parks, private streets, pedestrian pathways, lighting, fencing, entry sign/monumentation, and landscaping. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 221, 2008) A. PUDs shall be initiated by the owner of all property involved if under one ownership, or by joint application of all owners having title to all the property in the area proposed for PUD. B. The PUD process consists of two phases, a preliminary phase and a final phase. A preliminary PUD includes a site development plan illustrating the concept of the development and uses to be allowed. The decision by the Planning Commission to approve a preliminary PUD shall be binding. This preliminary phase shall not be construed as to render the final PUD inflexible. Said approval is valid for a five-year period, which may be extended up to three years by determination of the City Planner. Any extension of time must be requested by the applicant, in writing, prior to expiration of the original approval, stating specific reasons for such a request. C. The preliminary PUD application shall include all the requirements for a preliminary plat application contained in AHMC 16.03.030, 16.03.040, and 16.03.050, and shall be processed in accordance with AHMC Title 14, Development Code Administration. In addition, a complete PUD application shall include a PUD narrative and a PUD map, which shall include but is not limited to the following: 1. All proposed improvements that are to be constructed on the land and their locations, including, but not limited to, all residential and nonresidential structures, building heights, recreational facilities, site plans and information showing walls, fences, refuse areas, streets, sidewalks, and public transit facilities; 2. Common open space areas indicating size, grades, and functions upon completion;  3. Floor plans of typical dwelling units, the unit size in square feet, and the amount of private, noncommon open space in square feet; 4. Locations and dimension of all off-street parking facilities, public and private, including public transit and park and ride lots; 5. Locations and sizes of all public and semipublic sites, if applicable (i.e., schools, churches, parks, etc.); 6. A tabulation of the percentage of total building coverage in the development; 7. A tabulation of densities within each project area, phase, or sector; 8. Building elevations showing typical architectural styles to be constructed; 9. A schematic landscaping plan indicating the type and the size of plant material to be used and the method for providing permanent maintenance to all planted areas and open spaces; 10. A proposed phasing plan and/or timing schedule, if applicable. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 222, 2008) A. Before expiration of the preliminary PUD, approval of the final PUD is required. Approval of the final PUD shall be administrative unless the Planning Commission, at the preliminary PUD hearing, determines a public hearing on the final PUD is required as a condition of final approval. A final PUD differs from the preliminary PUD in the amount of detailed information provided. The final PUD shall include all the requirements for a final plat contained in Chapter 16.05 AHMC, including approved road plans and drainage systems, assurance of building and fire code compliance, and those requirements and conditions applied to preliminary PUD approval. Any PUD not finalized before the expiration of the preliminary PUD approval shall become void. Construction shall not commence until a PUD has been given final approval. B. No major changes in the approved final PUD, such as rearrangement of lots, blocks, streets, building locations, development standards, or other such changes, may be made subsequent to final development plan approval except upon application to the Planning Department and consideration by the Planning Commission. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 223, 2008) A. A PUD may be developed in phases or increments, subject to an approved phasing schedule. A master phasing plan shall be submitted with the preliminary PUD for approval by the City Planner. The phasing plan may be approved provided: 1. It includes all land identified in the legal description for the project; 2. The phasing sequence is identified by a map; 3. Each phase has reasonable public or private infrastructure to support the number of dwelling units contained within that phase; 4. The unfinalized portion meets the minimum lot size of the underlying zone for the proposed use, or as further provided under this chapter; and 5. The City approves the necessary documents so that all road improvements required are assured for that phase. B. A phasing plan may be amended following preliminary PUD approval. The amended phasing plan may be approved by the City Planner provided the above criteria are met. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 224, 2008) Following approval of a preliminary PUD by the Planning Commission, and before administrative approval of the final PUD, the applicant shall complete minimum improvements in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 16.04 AHMC by one of the following methods: A. By furnishing the City with a performance bond, satisfactory to the City Attorney, in which assurance is given the City that the installation of the minimum improvements will be carried out as provided in this chapter, Chapter 16.04 AHMC, and other City ordinances, and according to the specifications of the City Engineer, within three years from the date the final PUD is approved by the City Planner: 1. The City Council may grant a one-year extension beyond the required three years if the applicant furnishes an extension to the performance bond, satisfactory to the City Attorney; B. By actual installation of improvements in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and in accordance with the installation requirements and under the supervision of the City Engineer; C. By a combination of these methods. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 225, 2008) In the PUD overlay zone, no building, structure, or improvements shall be erected, constructed, converted, established, altered, or enlarged, nor shall any lot or premises be used except for those uses specifically permitted in the following zones: A. Single-family residential zone (R-1); B. Manufactured housing zone (RM); C. Duplex residential zone (R-2); D. Multiple-family residential zone (R-3). (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 226, 2008) Within a PUD, all accessory uses, buildings, and structures are allowed in conformance with this title and the underlying zone in which the PUD is located. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 227, 2008) The major internal streets serving each PUD shall be functionally connected to at least one minor arterial or collector street as defined in the Airway Heights Public Works Standards. The streets connecting with any PUD, regardless of the zone in which it is located, must be of sufficient size and character to accommodate the traffic generated by the project, without significantly altering the character of existing residential neighborhoods. Evaluation of the proposal pursuant to this title shall include consideration of the following criteria: A. The increase of traffic which will be generated by the development; B. The existing width and condition of streets to be affected; C. The presence or absence of improved sidewalks; D. Potential impacts upon the value of surrounding properties; E. The anticipated impact upon availability of parking; F. The existence of a particular conflict between vehicular and pedestrian traffic; G. The street type designated by the Public Works Standards. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 228, 2008) Prior to the issuance of a building permit, evidence of compliance with the provisions of AHMC 17.17.100 through 17.17.250 shall be provided to the Planning Department. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 229, 2008) A. In any PUD, the number of dwelling units per acre of land shall not exceed that permitted by the underlying zone, except as approved for density bonus by the Planning Commission. Residential bonus density shall be determined by using the following formula: Net development factor x number of units allowed in underlying zone + bonus density earned = total units permitted. The net development factor is the total acreage of the PUD minus the area set aside for, or existing in, any of the following: 1. Churches and schools; 2. Commercial and/or industrial uses; 3. Single-family residential platted area, if determining net development factor for the multifamily portion of a mixed, single-family/multiple-family development; 4. Natural water bodies, including lakes, streams, swamps, marshes, and bogs which are not incorporated in the common open space plan of the PUD; 5. Seventy-five percent of areas having slopes which exceed 40 percent; 6. Public streets. B. The following units per acre may be cumulatively earned as additional density to the base unit density of the underlying zone: 1. Common Open Spaces. a. Three-tenths unit per acre bonus if at least 10 percent of the dry, common open space has a slope of 10 percent or less; b. Three-tenths unit per acre bonus if significant recreation areas are developed and equipped with such features as, but not limited to, trails, landscaped open areas, pools, tennis courts, children\u2019s play areas, etc. 2. Environmental Concerns. a. Fifteen one-hundredths unit per acre bonus if on-site drainage control is accomplished through integrating facilities into the usable common open space or common recreation area; b. Fifteen one-hundredths unit per acre bonus if significant general public access is provided to a lake or river, one-tenth unit per acre bonus to trails; one-tenth unit per acre bonus to scenic viewpoints. 3. Internal Circulation and Parking. a. One-tenth unit per acre bonus if the off-street parking is 50 feet or less from the entrance to the building served; if one can walk under cover from structure to parking, the parking may be up to 150 feet away and still receive the bonus; b. Two-tenths unit per acre bonus if one-half of the required parking is covered; three-tenths unit per acre bonus if all the required parking is covered; c. Fifteen-one-hundredths unit per acre bonus if parking areas are kept small (10 to 20 spaces in a group) and interspersed with landscaping, or provided within or under main buildings; d. Fifteen-one-hundredths unit per acre bonus if provisions are made for an internal bikeway, physically separated from, and not adjacent to, heavy auto traffic facilities. 4. Public Service and Facility Availability. a. Fifteen-one-hundredths unit per acre bonus if public transit is available within one-quarter-mile walking distance of the majority of dwelling units and offices; b. Fifteen-one-hundredths unit per acre bonus if off-site convenience shopping facilities are functionally accessible within reasonable walking distance (approximately one-half mile); c. One-tenth unit per acre bonus if sewer and water lines lie within, or are adjacent to, the site at the time of application, and the sewer district and water district indicate that their systems will not be stressed by the added development; d. Fifteen-one-hundredths unit per acre bonus if the primary means of access to the project is via an arterial; e. One-tenth unit per acre bonus if the development provides a crime prevention plan, incorporating locks, dwelling unit lighting, street lighting, doors, windows, and alarms, approved by the City of Airway Heights Police Department, if such crime prevention plan is not in conflict with other applicable laws and ordinances; f. One-tenth unit per acre bonus if the project is located within a portion of a school district which that district has identified as a preferred enrollment growth area, consistent with that district\u2019s five-year planning objectives; g. Fifteen one-hundredths unit per acre bonus if integrated special facilities and a program to encourage and facilitate use of public transit and other ride-sharing (e.g., van/carpooling) are incorporated into the design and operation of the project (e.g., sheltered, lighted waiting/loading facilities, including benches; posted and distributed schedule/route information; park-and-ride spaces; carpool matching programs; subscription bus service; bus passes incorporated in monthly maintenance charges). This effort must be approved by the Planning Department in consultation with the Spokane Transit Authority (STA); h. Two-tenths unit per acre bonus if the applicant uses a design/development team, consisting of an architect, engineer, landscape architect, land surveyor, and builder, through the design and construction phases of the project; i. Fifteen-one-hundredths unit per acre bonus if the development features a mix of housing types with at least 10 percent of the total dwelling units being detached single-family dwellings. Detached single-family residences; attached single-family residences; duplexes; townhouses and apartments are examples of housing types. C. Proposed land uses within accident potential zones must comply with the population density guidelines outlined in the air installation compatible use zone (AICUZ) study prepared by Fairchild Air Force Base. (Ord. C-675 \u00a7 230, 2008) Each lot used for residential purposes shall have a minimum area of 800 square feet, unless the underlying zone(s) specifically sets minimum lot areas for residential purposes in a PUD. (Ord.
